## **Table games made smart. Smart games made social.**

Move38 seeks to delight hands, challenge minds, and inspire curiosity. We believe we learn best when at play, and that our play shapes who we are.

We're creating a new kind of tabletop game, with components that think for themselves, talk to each other, and come alive under your fingertips. Being digital doesn't mean we have to sacrifice the social aspect of gameplay, bringing the best of digital to hands-on, face-to-face experiences. 

Also, we were founded by these two yokels:

## Backstory

One of the simplest games to learn, and difficult to master is over a thousand years old. Go, consisting of a 19x19 grid board, has so many possible moves at any given moment, that it was thought impossible for a computer to play at the same level as a human. Only recently, the worlds best Go player, Lee Sodol, faced-off against Alpha Go, an AI built by Google engineers. In a 5 game match, there was only one moment that caught everyone by surprise. Alpha Go, made one move that no single professional player predicted, resulting in a powerful win. That move, was move 37. We are the human response, Move38, thinking about what it means to play with systems.
