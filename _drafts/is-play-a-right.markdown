title: Do we have a right to play?

Since we're starting a company with play as a central value, I've been thinking about it. What is it, and do we have a right to it?

Let's start with what it means to play. I don't have one single definition. Instead I propose there are two kinds of play:

* competitive play: what you do when you're trying to win a game

* exploratory play: what you do with your action figures on a rainy Sunday when you're 12.

Here's the difference:

* competitive play is goal-driven, bound by rules, and not much hindered by fear (in fact fear can drive competitive play). The purpose is to experience the thrill of understanding and achievement beyond what's possible in day-to-day life.

* exploratory play isn't goal-driven, isn't bound by rules, and is hindered by fear. The purpose is to delight in curiosity and imagination.

Each is vital to learning, each in it's own unique way. Competitive play is freely available to almost everyone, but that's not the case with exploratory play. 

The reason is fear. Exploratory play requires a feeling of freedom, to indulge curiosity, follow your nose, "waste time", and set aside the cost-benefit analyses looping in your head. Worry is kryptonite to exploratory play, and it doesn't take much to make it impossible. A little nagging feeling at the edge of consciousness that comes from a looming deadline or an unpaid bill is enough to make exploratory play impossible.  

Everyone fears, but some more than others. Kids tend to fear less than adults, the rich less than the poor, whites less than non-whites (in the U.S.), etc. Not only that, but it's hard to control at will.

Consequently, it's easier for some of us to engage in exploratory play than others.

Fear is also what makes exploratory play seem alternately precious and frivolous.

Precious because fear, in degrees minor and profound, is ubiquitous, so exploratory play is rare no matter who you are.

Frivolous because for swaths of humanity, fear is necessary, and exploratory play therefore seems like a nice perk afforded to the lucky among us who have escaped the need for constant watchfulness.

As a white man from a comfortable background (looking at these words, I imagine I'm sitting at a slot machine, watching them rotate into alignment), I'm lucky. I've spent much of my adult life trying to cultivate a spirit of exploratory play, mainly because from where I sit, it looks like freedom. But I feel guilt too, since it feels like an exclusive luxury.

I've noticed spaces in which adults gather to cultivate exploratory play tend to be white. For example:

* improv clubs - I did improv for three years (it's one of the most important things I've done for myself), and oh my god was it white

* Burning Man - I've never been but it has a [notorious reputation for whiteness](https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2015/sep/04/burning-man-founder-larry-harvey-race-diversity-silicon-valley)

My theory is that the more fear you've lived with, the harder or more frivolous (or both) these sorts of pursuits seem.  So you don't undertake them. You leave them to others.

But. If it's true, as I believe, that we learn best at play, it means inequality of exploratory play could be another means through which privilege breeds privilege. I, blithe white guy born to wealthy parents, can explore my interests more freely than someone more encumbered by fear, leading to opportunities out of others' reach, and this is an advantage beyond what material advantages I may enjoy. Even if I were poor, my playful attitude toward life, baked in since childhood, would not go away. 

An example close at hand: my participation in this business, Move38, the business whose site you're now reading.

I was traveling for work in Boston, staying at the house of a friend teaching at MIT (this story originates in a traditional kind of privilege - my friends have access to resources), and he told me there was an inventor in the MIT Media Lab who I had to meet.

So we went to the Media Lab and I met an amazing man named Jonathan Bobrow, who'd created a kind of board game with pieces that can think for themselves, communicate with one another, and act like living things. I played with them briefly, I talked to Jonathan briefly, and was moved by both.

Here's where the privilege of play comes in: then and there, I told Jonathan if he wanted to commercialize his invention, I would leave my job and join him in doing so.

I discovered something delightful and I pursued it without fear. There was no cost-benefit analysis. I made my decision playfully. Of course there was apprehension later, once I gave my 30 days' notice, because I'm human and fear is a condition of life, even for the lucky.

But it wasn't enough to keep me from making the playful choice. Here I am. I can do this because I'm used to living with only a modicum of fear and a bedrock belief I'll land on my feet.

So. Exploratory play is yet another dimension of the social capital that keeps people like me hitting jackpots in life's slot machines.

But it shouldn't be that way. It shouldn't be a privilege. It should be an inalienable right.

I don't know how it'll become so or how we can contribute to it. Our first product won't address fear. I don't even know where to start.

So for now it's a dream, but we won't forget it.
