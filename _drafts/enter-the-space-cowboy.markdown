We asked for a "Game Astronaut" and sure enough a couple of months later, in its place, came our Space Cowboy. We would like to formally and warmly welcome the newest member of our team, Josh Levine.

What is Josh's new role and where did he come from? Josh is a talented an curious Electrical Engin...explorer. Seriously, he travels where other EE's dare not go and along the way creates the kind of wondrous devices, Move38 seeks to deliver. In our book, Josh is a homerun hitter and a team player, which is a rare find if you don't play or follow baseball analogies. 

While Josh is not a games player, he is enthusiastic about the medium, and loves learning the details of their creation. In fact, he has made a couple of games himself. We are going to hold him to the fire to make sure he designs a game or two for Blinks as well.

As for the "where did he come from" part, our best guess is that Gotham is peaceful for the moment, and he found himself out of work :)

In all honesty, Josh isn't the limelight type, but he is fond of sharing his knowledge, in a way we hold close to our hearts, open source, and with fun blog posts.

Move38 has been learning what it takes to not simply make a product, but to build a company, and we are trying to do it in ways that simply amplify our best traits. We feel so fortunate to have wonderful discussions with everyone following along, and the great introductions that have lead to working relationships....
