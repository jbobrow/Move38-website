> A modern-day Montessori might porpose, if convinced by my story, to create a gear set for children. Thus every child might have the experience I had. But to hope for this would be to miss the essence of the story. *I fell in love with the gears*. This is something that cannot be reduced to purely "cognitive" terms. Something very personal happened, and one cannot assume that it would be repeated for other children in exactly the same form.

> My Thesis could be summarized as: What the gears cannot do the computer might. The computer is the Proteus of machines. Its essence is its universality, its power to simulate. Because it can take on a thousand forms and can serve a thousand functions, it can appeal to a thousand tasted. This book is the result of my own attempts over the past decade to turn computers into instruments flexible enough so that many children can each create for themselves something like what the gears were for me.

- Seymour Pappert, Mind Storms

There is a cultural problem right now being born out of an era of Silicon Valley  success stories and a generation of children raised to program computers. The current mindset that solves problems with code approaches other social issues with the same set of tools. Coders work with absolutes. Digital computers are predicated on the idea of boolean values. A bit is on or off. The rest of the world does not function the same way, and failing to recognize this creates unintended consequences. 

I propose a completely different way of learning to code. Learning to code should be fun, make people feel in control of small actions,  and make people think about the complexity of systems. With AutomaTiles, coding it easy. Programs are limited in size and limited in complexity. Each tile can be given rules based on a simple set of functions. Together, the tiles reveal complex properties that emerge from the aggregate of simple actions. 

There doesn't exist a single toy or platform on the market today that allows children or adults to program a single agent and observe how properties  emerge from seemingly simple singular tasks among a population of agents.
