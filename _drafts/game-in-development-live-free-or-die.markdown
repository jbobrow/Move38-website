For the last month we've been posting about our new game platform, but we've only shown off one game so far. Time to fix that. 

Today we're showing off an in-development game that couldn't really exist without our system to play it on.  

* pieces age during each game, and eventually die.

* the rate at which each piece ages depends on how many enemies surround it
