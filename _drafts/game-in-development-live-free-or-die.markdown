We've been posting about [our new table game platform](http://move38.com/blog/a-board-game-that-thinks/) for more than a month, but we've only shown off one game. That's a crime and it's time for justice.

For those who don't know what I'm talking about, Automatiles are little hexagonal bots that emit beautiful LED light in full RGB, they communicate with players and each other through light, and they can think and remember. They can be used to implement all kinds of games that wouldn't otherwise be possible on a tabletop, and if I may say so, they might be mistaken for a new form of life.

Today we show off an in-development game that wouldn't likely exist without AutomaTiles. I'll describe the current rules first, and then where it came from.

The key idea behind the game is that *the pieces age and die, and the last player with a living piece wins.*

**Current Rules**

* the game is for two players (for now).

* one player owns 3 purple tiles; the other owns 3 green tiles.

* at the start, the pieces are arranged like this:


* the players take turns

* on your turn, you must move any tile (of either color), or any group of tiles (of any combination of colors). This means you detach them from the group and put them back together with the group in any arrangement. The tiles you move must be detachable without lifting them from the table (for example you can't move a tile surrounded by 5-6 other tiles).

* The tiles' lights pulse gently, and the rate of the pulse indicates how close they are to death (they panic increasingly as death approaches). When a piece dies it becomes white (a ghost).

* The rate at which each piece ages depends on who its neighbors are. A piece with more enemies than friends around it will age quickly. A piece with equal numbers of enemies and friends will age at a medium rate, and a piece with more friends than enemies around it will age slowly.

* When you move a single piece, it gains life (20% of its starting life - exercise is good!) Note: when you move more than one piece as a group, none gain life.

* You may not move an individual ghost, but you may a ghost as part of a group.

* The last player with a living tile on the table wins.

Each game is intense and lasts just a minute or two. Because you gain life each time you move, it's rarely to your advantage to delay taking your turn while you wait for enemy pieces to die.

**Origin**

One of the weirdest games in the annals of board game history is called Tamsk:

In Tamsk:

* each piece is a sand-timer, and each player owns several.

* When a sand-timer runs out, the player who owns it can no longer use it.

* When you move a sand-timer, you flip it, thus delaying its death. 

There are additional rules that make it somewhat complicated, but the goal is the same: kill all your opponent's pieces by making them run out of time.

Tamsk didn't work for a number of reasons: it was expensive, the sand-timers could be glitchy, and it was maybe too complicated for the time-pressure it put players under.

That's no knock against the designer though ([Kris Burm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kris_Burm), one of the greatest board game designers ever for my money). It's just hard to create a traditional board game with time as an intrinsic strategic variable.

But for AutomaTiles it's easier, so we thought we should try to design a game like that. And so we're working on it.

Because the tiles can communicate with one another, they can be made to do cool things with time that you could never do with a traditional board game, for example have tiles suck the life out of each other like cute little retributive vampires (and indeed they do).

Live Free or Die is still in development and may change a lot before we're done; feel free to share your opinions about how you'd like to see it develop (though know we may feel free to ignore them), or other ideas for games this might inspire.
