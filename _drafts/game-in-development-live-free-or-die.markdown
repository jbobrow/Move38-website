We've been posting about our new game platform for more than a month now, but we've only shown off one game so far. That's a crime and it's time for justice.

Today we're showing off an in-development game that wouldn't likely exist without our system to play it on. I'll describe the current rules first, and then discuss where it came from and where it's going.

The key idea behind the game is that *the pieces age and die, and the last player with a living piece wins.*

**Current Rules**

* the game is for two players (this might change).

* one player owns 3 purple tiles; the other owns 3 green tiles.

* at the start of the game, the pieces are arranged like this:

* the players take turns

* on your turn, you must move any tile (of either color), or any group of tiles (of any combination of colors). This means you detach them from the group and put them back together with the group in any arrangement. The tiles you move must be detachable without lifting them from the table (so for example you can't move a tile surrounded by 5-6 other tiles). 

* The tiles' lights are gently pulsing, and the rate of the pulse indicates how close they are to death (they get panicked as death draws near). When a piece dies it becomes white (a ghost). 

* The rate at which each piece ages depends on who its neighbors are. A piece with more enemies than friends around it will age quickly. A piece with equal numbers of enemies and friends will age at a medium rate, and a piece with more friends than enemies around it will age slowly. 

* When you move a single piece, it gains life (20% of it's starting life, to be exact). Exercise is good. Note: when you move more than one piece as a group, none gain life. 

* You may not move an individual ghost, but you may a ghost as part of a group.

* The last player with a living tile on the board wins. 

Each game will last just a few minutes

**Origin**

One of the weirdest games in the annals of board game history is called Tamsk:
