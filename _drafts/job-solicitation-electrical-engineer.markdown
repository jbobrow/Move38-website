We're looking to hire an electrical engineer.

If you're one, please read this!  If you're not, please also read this! We'll hire for other positions soon and we don't want you to slip through the cracks, plus this document is more than just a job solicitation and may be worth a look for those interested in entrepreneurship.

If what follows overclocks your cpu, do get in touch.

## About Us

At present, our team consists of two people: [Jonathan Bobrow:](http://cargo.jonathanbobrow.com/)

...who is balding

We founded Move38 to foster playfulness as a way of life. We think we're at our best when we approach our lives playfully. It makes our thinking clearer, our learning faster, our work better, and us happier. 

But playfulness is delicate. We're born with it but if it's not cultivated [it can wither in the heat of life's hardships](http://move38.com/blog/is-play-a-right/). The world needs green thumbs for playfulness. That's us.

## Current Work

Our first project, the one for which we're hiring, is a [tabletop game platform with programmable components that can think for themselves](http://www.move38.com/blog/a-board-game-that-thinks/).  It has a screenless, friendly, tactile interface, and it feels like a living thing. It offers a new play experience that builds intuition for principles to which kids (and many adults) aren't otherwise much exposed.

Principles of, for example, distributed computation, nonlinear dynamics, emergent complexity. Ideas critical for understanding the modern world but which even now are confined mostly to the walled gardens of academia and tech companies.

We emphasize our first product priority is to offer thundering fun. We stand athwart chocolate broccoli: if you put chocolate on broccoli, it's still broccoli. Likewise if you try to dress up an "educational" game with a veneer of "fun".

So we're devoted to designing things that are delightful all the way through, chocolate chocolate if you will, because that way lies playfulness. We learn best from the things we love most.

## **Other Key Values**

* We relish detail without getting lost in it.

* We value our partners in life and our time on Earth, and our schedules reflect that. Sometimes we make exceptions because we love what we do, but we don't let exceptions become the norm.

* We believe in [thinking time.](http://www.inc.com/empact/why-successful-people-spend-10-hours-a-week-just-thinking.html)

* We try to cultivate an atmosphere of [psychological safety](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/28/magazine/what-google-learned-from-its-quest-to-build-the-perfect-team.html?_r=0). 

* We try to face our flaws with a light heart and work steadily to improve.

## You 

First there's the straightforward stuff. We're looking for a great electrical engineer who's into her/his work, and ideally also games and design thinking. But the basics are (relatively) easy, necessary but not sufficient for our ideal outcome. What's our ideal outcome?

1. *We help each other work, think, and live with uncommon intelligence*

2. *We have more fun than anyone has a right to expect*

3. *We become friends and project partners for life*

Achieving these depends on more than our qualifications; it depends on what kind of people we are and how we carry ourselves. Likewise we're looking for people who can help get us there, people who:

* can enjoy others' successes

* prioritize listening over talking (yet enjoy talking)

* aren't given to anger or apprehension

* have a warm sense of humor

* exhibit empathy, humility, and curiosity

## How we'll hire

We don't think we can understand what someone is like from a resume and an interview. We want to spend time with you, ideally working. [There are lots of ways to do so](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/young-entrepreneur-council/15-ideas-for-testing-your_b_2680528.html). We favor hiring on contract for a short-term project at first, and if everyone is happy with the results, we get married. Mazel tov to us!

## **Your first project**

A key near-term goal is to put a refined version of our current beta into the hands of developers and early adopters. To do that, we need to make the hardware more robust, add a few features (like power management), and better understand our options for managing component costs. Working through these issues (possibly in collaboration with a PCBA house we will work with) will be your first assignment.

## Bottom Line

If you're an electrical engineer, you're still reading, and you think we might make beautiful music together, send your resume, 3 references, and other evidence beautiful music will be made to jobs@move38.com. If you're not an electrical engineer but think you could make a vital contribution and want us to keep you in mind, do also get in touch.

We're grateful to those who share this. Life is fleeting and we don't want to waste anyone's time by hiring the wrong person.
