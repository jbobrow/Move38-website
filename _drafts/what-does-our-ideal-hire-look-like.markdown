We're looking for an electrical engineer to add to our team and decided it will be useful to outline what we're looking for in more expansive terms than one usually finds in job solicitations. 

**the basics**

First, there are the straightforward, easy-to-articulate requirements. We're looking for:

* 

* 

But these basic requirements are the easy stuff, necessary but not sufficient for our ideal outcome. What's our ideal outcome?

*We help each other work and think with uncommon intelligence, have more fun than anyone has a right to expect, and become great friends and project partners for life.*

**disclaimers**

* we acknowledge it's a tall order.

* we acknowledge that, like most ideals, we'll fail to achieve it in some way or to some degree. That's ok.

* we acknowledge getting there depends as much on us as it does on who we hire. We can't achieve this unless we're living and working in ways consistent with that ideal outcome, and sometimes we aren't. For example just now I ate way too much chocolate and my tummy ache is limiting the amount of fun I could be having.

**So what are the less-obvious requirements?**

Google's HR people [conducted a study](https://rework.withgoogle.com/blog/five-keys-to-a-successful-google-team/) suggesting a team's productivity depends less on the qualifications of its members (bearing in mind that all of them are individually qualified enough to be hired by Google) than on how they treat and relate to each other.

They identified 5 factors that collectively predicted the productivity of Google's internal teams. Far and away, the most important factor was something they dubbed *psychological safety.*

**Psychological safety: the feeling that you can take risks without feeling embarrassed or insecure**

At present, our team consists of two people: the incomparable [Jonathan Bobrow:](http://cargo.jonathanbobrow.com/)

... and [yours truly:](https://nickbentleygames.wordpress.com/)

One thing attracting me to this project is the instant safety I felt with Jonathan upon meeting, which has continued. I feel free to discuss my failures with him, something I otherwise find hard to do, thanks to a fear of disappointing people (and myself). I cherish the feeling because talking about my weaknesses helps me accept and work on them, rather than pretending they're not there and hoping no one notices.

So  do we find team members that contribute to a culture psychological safety? 

.....

The other 4 predictive factors were:

> **Dependability:** Can we count on each other to do high quality work on time?
>
> **Structure & clarity:** Are goals, roles, and execution plans on our team clear?
>
> **Meaning of work:** Are we working on something that is personally important for each of us?
>
> **Impact of work:** Do we fundamentally believe that the work weâ€™re doing matters?
