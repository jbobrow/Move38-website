We're looking for an electrical engineer to add our team and thought it would be useful to outline what we're looking for in more expansive terms than one usually sees in job solicitations.

**the basics**

First, there are the straightforward, easy-to-articulate requirements. We're looking for:

* 

* 

But these basic requirements are the easy stuff, necessary but not sufficient for our ideal outcome. What's our ideal outcome?

*We help each other work and think with uncommon intelligence, have more fun than anyone has a right to expect, and become great friends and project partners for life.*

**disclaimers**

* we acknowledge it's a tall order.

* we acknowledge that, like most ideals, we'll fail to achieve it in some way or to some degree. That's ok.

* we acknowledge getting there depends as much on us as it does on who we hire. We can't achieve this unless we're living and working in ways consistent with that ideal outcome, and sometimes we aren't. For example just now I ate way too much chocolate, and my tummy ache is limiting the amount of fun I could be having.

**So what are the less-obvious requirements?**

Google's HR people [conducted a study](https://rework.withgoogle.com/blog/five-keys-to-a-successful-google-team/) suggesting the productivity of a team depends less on the qualifications of its members than on how they treat and relate to each other.

They identified 5 factors that collectively predicted the productivity of Google's internal teams. Far and away, the most important factor was something they dubbed *psychological safety.*

**Psychological safety: the feeling that you can take risks without feeling embarrassed or insecure**

At present, our team consists of only two people: the incomparable [Jonathan Bobrow:](http://cargo.jonathanbobrow.com/)

... and [yours truly:](https://nickbentleygames.wordpress.com/)

One thing attracting me to this project is the immediate psychological safety I felt with Jonathan the moment we met. This manifests for me, for example, in the fact that I feel free to discuss my failures with him, something I often find very hard to do, because I have a strong fear of disappointing both myself and others. I cherish this feeling because talking about my weaknesses helps me accept and work on them, rather than pretending they're not there and nervously hoping no one notices.

The other 4 predictive factors were:

> 2. **Dependability:** Can we count on each other to do high quality work on time?
>
>
> 3. **Structure & clarity:** Are goals, roles, and execution plans on our team clear?
>
>
> 4. **Meaning of work:** Are we working on something that is personally important for each of us?
>
>
> 5. **Impact of work:** Do we fundamentally believe that the work weâ€™re doing matters?

All of this is entirely consistent with my own experience. I've been in situations where it was ferociously difficult to work hard and well, and in others where it was effortless. The differentiating factor seems to have been the people I was working with, not the work itself. I think I could enjoy cleaning port-a-potties if I were surrounded by the right people.
