We're looking for an electrical engineer to add our team and thought it would be useful to outline what we're looking for in more expansive terms than one usually sees in job solicitations. 

**the basics**

First, there are the straightforward, easy-to-articulate requirements. We're looking for:

* 

* 

But these basic requirements are the easy stuff, necessary but not sufficient for our ideal outcome. What's our ideal outcome?

*We help each other work and think with uncommon intelligence, have more fun than anyone has a right to expect, and become great friends and project partners for life.*

**disclaimers**

* we acknowledge it's a tall order.

* we acknowledge that, like most ideals, we'll fail to achieve it in some way or to some degree. That's ok. 

* we acknowledge getting there depends at least as much on us as it does on whoever we hire. We can't achieve this unless we're living and working in ways consistent with that ideal outcome, and sometimes we aren't. For example just now I ate way too much chocolate, and my tummy ache is limiting the amount of fun I could be having.  

**So what are the less obvious requirements?**

Google's HR people conducted a study suggesting the productivity of a team depends less on the qualifications of its members and more on how they treat and relate to each other.
