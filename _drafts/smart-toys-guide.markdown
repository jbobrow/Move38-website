As we've mentioned, we're developing a tabletop game platform with digital components. If we do it right, it'll feel like a board game come alive on your table.

To understand our future competition, we've been researching smart games and smart toys. It occurred to us that, because the holidays are near, parents might benefit from what we've learned to make their gift choices this year. We've got nothing to sell and there's no reason for us not to share our opinions.

## Only the good ones

Our list consists of physical toys with digital components that have some learning value. There are  a million digital toys that don't make the cut here, either because they're cheaply or thoughtlessly made, or they don't offer learning value, or we think they'll end up unplayed and unloved at the bottom of some toy bin somewhere a week after the holidays. So we're covering only those we think of as the good ones. Here we go:

Sphero - remote controlled programmable ball
Little Bits - programmable building blocks
Cubelets  - programmable building blocks
Makey Makey - invention kit that turns everyday object into digital user interfaces
Ozobot - programmable robot
Cubetto - programmable robot
Root - a robot to grow with from our friends at Harvard Wyss

Honeycomb - Like Little Bits, but with a branching structure, which in theory provides more features, but haven't seen any yet.
