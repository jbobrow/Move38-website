Two weeks ago, I went to IndieCade for the first time and I fell ass over teakettle for it. It couldn't have been more enjoyable (except for one thing, but I'll get to that).

First, thanks to the hundreds of people who came to IndieCade and peeled themselves away from the tsunami of video games long enough to give our cyber-futurismo board game a shot. 

Second, a fat puffy thanks to [Celia Pearce](http://www.northeastern.edu/camd/gamedesign/people/celia-pearce/) for her game design skills and for prodding me to submit a game to IndieCade.

**Hands-on collaborative prototyping**

The festival started with workshops, on subjects like starting a company, grant writing, and making table-top games. It felt like a bespoke conference tailored exclusively to my needs. 

I also met wonderful developers and designers. To wit: [John Kane](https://twitter.com/gritfish), with whom I helped design a cooperative version of UNO. I'll lovingly call Deton-ocho, written Deton8.

In a span of 20 minutes, we deconstructed UNO and reconstructed it into our new game. We even balanced it. It was a reminder of how painless, nay delightful it is to prototype tabletop games, an aspect of AutomaTiles I look forward to others experiencing. 

([Fracture](http://move38.com/blog/a-board-game-that-thinks/), the game we submitted to IndieCade, also originated out of a session like this, where the original concept from Celia Pearce and Mechanics of Mike Lazer-Walker came together)

**Time flies like an arrow. Fruit flies like a banana.**

I hit the ground running with my friend [Mike Lazer-Walker](http://lazerwalker.com), a talented game designer. The first day of the festival only allowed 2 hours for playing Fracture, but I ended up going 4 hours and packing up only when the staff kindly told us to scram. The events of the day nearly convinced me to ignore our commitment to frugality and buy a ticket for Nick to fly out. The bean-counter in me prevailed though.  

If this was going to be how each day was, I wasn't sure how I would sleep, but the answer to that is with a big smile on my face.

**The stuff of dreams**

Each day continued to build on the previous one, with one amazing player even exclaiming that he had dreamed about playing Fracture again the night before and coming back to see if he could reign champion (which he did).

Some players approached the game out of the gates with heavy analysis and found the game to be long lasting as they each played defensively, preventing a win condition one move at a time.

Others worked collaboratively to achieve a Super Win, a rule invented once again by Celia Pearce, to encourage more cooperative play. The idea for this is that if in a single move, every tile can be put in a happy state, everyone wins, and the person who figured it out, extra wins :)

**Developers wanted**

Another delightful aspect of IndieCade is that a large portion of the population don't only think of themselves as game enthusiasts or game players, but also game makers. As mentioned in our previous post\[link\], we are looking for collaborators and developers as this platform lends itself to an entirely new form of tabletop games. One student of USC could not stop raving about how much fun she had playing, but even more-so, the thought of developing for them opens up a whole world of possibilities. It meant a lot to hear how the subtle affordances of each tile, such as the weight and feel, were noticed and appreciated.

**Mechanics and message**

I spoke about Fracture as a "competitive game towards diversity" which speaks to the origins of the game, being very abstractly about social integration, but the game evolved to become a strategic competitive game, not simply cooperative. The point was brought up that it seems hypocritical to have a game mechanic that suggest segregating others to make yourself more diverse, and call it a game towards diversity. I agree that game mechanics are often the way in which we learn behaviors, and to have mechanics inconsistent with the theme or message of a game is misleading and possibly upsetting. I am curious to discuss this more, as I think the cooperative version of this game still shows promise, but I can also change the language around the game, as it really has become a strategic abstract game. 

Lastly I want to address a moment that was not happy, but is important and meant a lot to me. (and ultimately ended up alright)

**Inclusivity**

A group of players arriving at the table were in a bit of a dispute over social issues as spawned from the content of another game. One of the players began acting in a way that made another player uncomfortable and was not acceptable to me. I very seriously said that Move38 provides safe-spaces, and that behavior and disrespecting another's opinion was not allowed in our space. This person stopped their behavior, and stuck around to play, but I want everyone to know that this is a core value of our company and one we will always stand by. There are respectful ways of treating each other no matter how big the disagreement, and we hold our players to the same standard we hold ourselves. (Note: The recipient of the poor behavior came over to hug out what was a frustrating situation)

All in all, the trip to Los Angeles, my hometown of 26 years was wonderful. The hour and half commute each way from the valley felt like nothing when every morning I was excited to show new people something that has been in the works for quite a while.

The community of people at IndieCade is what really made the trip for me. The fact that Fracture was a finalist, was flattering, and put me in company I felt lucky to be a part of. The awards ceremony put the entire diverse crowd inside of a single room and some truly meaningful works of passion won well deserved awards. In the words of [Rami Ismail](http://ramiismail.com/)

And ultimately it feels great to be at an event where that happens.

Nick and I both decided that these kinds of events are definitely worth attending, so feel free to let us know some of your favorite game festivals that we should be at in the comments.
