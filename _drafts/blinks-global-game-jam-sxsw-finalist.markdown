Blinks (formerly AutomaTiles), our smart tabletop game platform made of enchanted cellular automata, have been gaining traction in the new year and we thought it prudent to gloat about it here. So this is a gloating blog. A glog.

First, Blinks were the featured technology at New York University's Global Game Jam this past weekend (Jan 21-22). A bunch of talented people got involved and cool ideas emerged. Typical for an event where games are made in two days and no one sleeps, the implementations weren't polished, but the ideas were good enough that we want to keep working on them (with the developers' permission, of course). 

The winner was a cooperative game called Skiplight where players launch propagating waves of color into an array of Blinks. The goal is to make the waves meet at certain target Blinks in the array, where the colors mix and change the target to some desired color. Here's a video of the game (only sort of half-working at the time we took the video):

For their effort, Skiplight's makers got the first Blinks dev kit we've ever given out to anyone. That was a thrilling moment for us and we hope it was for them.
