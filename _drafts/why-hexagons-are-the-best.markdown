You know why you're here. Let's get down to it:

1. Hexagons one of only three kinds of regular polygons that tile the plane. Regular polygons are of course awesome because they're the most symmetrical polygons and symmetry is the basis for everything that is good in the universe. The other regular polygons that tile the plane are equilateral triangles (boring) and squares (square)

2. They have more sides than any other regular polygon that tiles the plane. So hotttt.

3. Hexagons tile the plane with the minimum total perimeter. Meaning if you draw a tiled plane, you'll minimize wear and tear on your pencil if you use hexagons to do it.

4. There's a [20,000 mile wide hexagon on Saturn](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-3867924/What-happening-giant-hexagon-Saturn-s-north-pole-Mystery-Nasa-images-area-changed-blue-gold-just-four-years.html). It's still unknown whether there's a similar structure on Uranus.

5. Honeybees make honey in them.

6. if you're into fancy dancy design stuff, you're legally obligated to use hexagons these days.

7. They're the basis of like, a huge swath of organic chemistry and like, life wouldn't exist without them. Benzene ring baby!

8. Normally we'd stop after 6 bullet points because that's the number of sides a hexagon has, but hexagons are so cool we have to keep going.
