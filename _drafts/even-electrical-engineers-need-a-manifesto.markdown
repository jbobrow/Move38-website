title: Even Electrical Engineers need a Manifesto

We're looking to hire an electrical engineer.

Because hiring decisions are the most important decisions a business makes, we're discussing our hiring goals, and what we're about, in more expansive terms than one usually finds in job solicitations.

If what follows overclocks your cpu, do get in touch.

## Us

We founded Move38 to foster playfulness as a way of life.

We think we're at our best when we approach our lives playfully. Our thinking is clearer, we learn faster, we work better, contribute more to the lives of others, and we're happier.

But playfulness is delicate. We're born with it but if it's not cultivated it can wither in the heat of life's hardships. The world needs green thumbs for playfulness and that's who we want to be. 

## Current Work

Our first project, the one for which we're hiring, is a [tabletop game platform with programmable components that can think for themselves](http://www.move38.com/blog/a-board-game-that-thinks/).  It has a screenless, friendly, tactile interface, and it feels like a living thing. It offers a new play experience that builds intuition for principles to which kids (and many adults) aren't otherwise much exposed.

Principles of, for example, nonlinear dynamics, emergent complexity, and parallel computation. Ideas critical for understanding how the world works but which even now are confined mostly to the walled gardens of academia and tech companies.

But we emphasize our first priority is to generate thundering fun. We're ferociously opposed to Chocolate Broccoli: if you put chocolate on broccoli, it's still broccoli, and it'll still taste like it. Likewise if you try to dress up an "educational" game with a veneer of "fun". 

We're devoted to designing things that are delightful in their bones, Chocolate Chocolate if you will, because that's the only way to foster playfulness. We learn best from the things we love most. 

## **Values**

* We enjoy ourselves but also treat sensitive issues seriously

* Our friends, colleagues, and mentors are precious to us

* We value our partners in life and our time on Earth, and our schedules reflect that. Sometimes we make exceptions because we love what we do, but those are just that: exceptions

* We help each other out, pick each other up, anticipate each others' moves, and win or lose we're always good sports

* We believe in [thinking time](http://www.inc.com/empact/why-successful-people-spend-10-hours-a-week-just-thinking.html)

## You

## **Team Goals**

1. We help each other work, think, and live with uncommon intelligence

2. We have more fun than anyone has a right to expect

3. We become friends and project partners for life

We acknowledge:

* it's a tall order.

* success depends as much on us as on who we hire. We have to live consistently with ideal, and sometimes we don't. For example just now I ate too much chocolate and my tummy ache is limiting the fun I could be having.

**The Science of Successful Teams (Dropping some science on y'all)**

Google's HR people [conducted a study](https://rework.withgoogle.com/blog/five-keys-to-a-successful-google-team/) suggesting a team's productivity depends less on its members traditional qualifications (bearing in mind all study subjects were qualified to be Googlers) than on how they relate to each other.

They found 5 factors collectively predicted the productivity of Google's internal teams. The most important by far was *psychological safety.*

**Psychological safety: the feeling that you can take risks without feeling embarrassed or insecure**

At present, our team consists of two people: [Jonathan Bobrow:](http://cargo.jonathanbobrow.com/)

...who has nice hair, and [yours truly:](https://nickbentleygames.wordpress.com/)

...who is balding

One thing attracting me to Move38 is the safety I felt with Jonathan upon meeting, which persists. I feel free to discuss my failures with him, something I otherwise find difficult, thanks to a fear of disappointing others (and myself). I cherish that because discussing my weaknesses helps me accept and work on them, rather than pretending they're not there and hoping no one notices.

<<This part may simply be implied by the stories we tell>>

How  do we find team members that contribute to a culture of psychological safety? Here are traits we think correlate:

* a warm sense of humor

* an ability to enjoy someone else's success

* prioritizes listening over talking (yet enjoys talking)

* not given to anger or apprehension

* empathy

* humility

* curiosity

The other 4 predictive factors from Google's study were:

> **Dependability:** Can we count on each other to do high quality work on time?
> **Meaning of work:** Are we working on something that is personally important for each of us?
> **Impact of work:** Do we fundamentally believe that the work weâ€™re doing matters?
> **Structure & clarity:** Are goals, roles, and execution plans on our team clear?

How do we know if someone has these traits (ignoring Structure and Clarity, which isn't a trait)? Spend lots of time with them, ideally working. [There are lots of ways to do so](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/young-entrepreneur-council/15-ideas-for-testing-your_b_2680528.html). We favor hiring at first on contract for a short-term project, and if everyone is happy with the results, we get married. Mazel tov to us!

**The First Responsibility**

We couldn't be more excited to put AutomaTiles into the hands of all the people our there that want them, but more importantly, we are excited to put a slightly refined version of our current beta into the hands of developers and early adopters alike. The hardware is simple and straight-forward, but needs to be robust. There are few features that need to be added, including power management and understanding costs of components. We have a wonderful relationship with a PCBA house and plan to iterate with them to arrive at the next revisions. Ownership and agency are important to us and we built this tech from the ground up with the help of a wonderful MIT Undergrad, Joshua Sloane. <<I'm fading a bit, so I can revisit in the morning>>

If you're an electrical engineer, you're still reading, and you think we might make beautiful music together, send us your resume, 3 references, and any other evidence beautiful music will be made to jobs@move38.com.

We're grateful to those who share this around. Life is fleeting and we don't want to waste anyone's time by hiring the wrong person.
