We're looking to hire an electrical engineer.

If you're one, please read this!  If you're not, please also read this! We'll hire for other positions soon and we don't want you to slip through the cracks, plus this document is more than just a job solicitation and may be worth a look for those interested in entrepreneurship.

If what follows overclocks your cpu, do get in touch.

## Us

We think we're at our best when we approach our lives playfully. It makes our thinking clearer, our learning faster, our work better, and us happier. We founded Move38 to foster playfulness as a way of life.

But playfulness is delicate. We're born with it but if it's not cultivated it can wither in the heat of life's hardships. The world needs green thumbs for playfulness. That's us.

## Current Work

Our first project, the one for which we're hiring, is a [tabletop game platform with programmable components that can think for themselves](http://www.move38.com/blog/a-board-game-that-thinks/).  It has a screenless, friendly, tactile interface, and it feels like a living thing. It offers a new play experience that builds intuition for principles to which kids (and many adults) aren't otherwise much exposed.

Principles of, for example, nonlinear dynamics, emergent complexity, and parallel computation. Ideas critical for understanding the modern world but which even now are confined mostly to the walled gardens of academia and tech companies.

We emphasize our first product priority is to offer thundering fun. We object to chocolate broccoli: if you put chocolate on broccoli, it's still broccoli, and it still tastes like it. Likewise if you try to dress up an "educational" game with a veneer of "fun".

So we're devoted to designing things that are delightful all the way through, chocolate chocolate if you will, because that way lies playfulness. We learn best from the things we love most.

**Other Key Values**

* We value our partners in life and our time on Earth, and our schedules reflect that. Sometimes we make exceptions because we love what we do, but we don't let exceptions become the norm.

* We believe in [thinking time.](http://www.inc.com/empact/why-successful-people-spend-10-hours-a-week-just-thinking.html)

* We try to face our flaws with a light heart and work steadily to improve.

* We think dad jokes are cool.

## You

First there's the straightforward stuff. We're looking for a great electrical engineer who's into her/his work, and ideally also games and design thinking. But the basics are (relatively) easy, necessary but not sufficient for our ideal outcome. What's our ideal outcome?

1. *We help each other work, think, and live with uncommon intelligence*

2. *We have more fun than anyone has a right to expect*

3. *We become friends and project partners for life*

That brings us to...

## More Complicated Team Stuff

Google's HR people [conducted a study](https://rework.withgoogle.com/blog/five-keys-to-a-successful-google-team/) suggesting a team's productivity depends less on its members' traditional qualifications (bearing in mind all study subjects were qualified to be Googlers) than on how they relate to each other.

They found 5 factors collectively predict the productivity of Google's internal teams. The most important by far is *psychological safety.*

**Psychological safety: the feeling that you can take risks without feeling embarrassed or insecure**

At present, our team consists of two people: [Jonathan Bobrow:](http://cargo.jonathanbobrow.com/)

...who has nice hair, and [yours truly:](https://nickbentleygames.wordpress.com/)

...who is balding

One thing attracting me to Move38 is the safety I felt with Jonathan upon meeting, which persists. I feel free to discuss my failures with him, something I otherwise find difficult, thanks to a fear of disappointing others (and myself). I cherish it because discussing my weaknesses helps me accept and work on them, rather than pretending they're not there and hoping no one notices. (Note psychological safety *doesn't* mean feeling like you're traipsing through daisies all the time; it means knowing others believe in you and have your back, especially when things are hard)

How  do we find team members that contribute to a culture of psychological safety? Here are traits we think correlate:

* an ability to enjoy someone else's success

* prioritizes listening over talking (yet enjoys talking)

* not given to anger or apprehension

* a warm sense of humor

* empathy

* humility

* curiosity

Note we only think these factors are correlational, and that no single factor is particularly predictive. I know utterly humorless people who make others feel quite safe, for example. So don't worry if you're not the living embodiment of these qualities.  

The other 4 predictive factors from Google's study were (Google says psychological safety underlies all of these, which is why it's so important):

> **Dependability:** Can we count on each other to do high quality work on time?
>
> **Meaning of work:** Are we working on something personally important to us?
>
> **Impact of work:** Do we believe the work weâ€™re doing matters?
>
> **Structure & clarity:** Are goals, roles, and execution plans on our team clear?

How do we know if someone will contribute to a group culture to foster these qualities? Spend time with them, ideally working. [There are lots of ways to do so](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/young-entrepreneur-council/15-ideas-for-testing-your_b_2680528.html). We favor hiring on contract for a short-term project at first, and if everyone is happy with the results, we get married. Mazel tov to us!

## **Your first project**

A key near-term goal is to put a refined version of our current beta into the hands of developers and early adopters. To do that, we need to make the hardware more robust, add a few features (like power management), and better understand our options for managing component costs. Working through these issues (possibly in collaboration with a PCBA house we will work with) will be your first assignment.

## Bottom Line

If you're an electrical engineer, you're still reading, and you think we might make beautiful music together, send your resume, 3 references, and other evidence beautiful music will be made to jobs@move38.com.

We're grateful to those who share this. Life is fleeting and we don't want to waste anyone's time by hiring the wrong person.
