Recently [Slate interviewed one of our favorite writers, Steven Johnson](http://www.slate.com/articles/podcasts/gist/2016/12/author_steven_johnson_on_the_role_of_delight_in_society_s_progress.html), Author of [Wonderland: How Play Made the Modern World](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01CZCW2PQ/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1), about "the things that people did, for no other reason other than the fact that they were fun"

His thesis is that "pursuit of things we want, not the things we need" move the world, perhaps more even than "the quest for power, nationalism, or religious beliefs", as is normally assumed. Moreover many leisure pursuits are not the waste of time our culture often assumes them to be. 

I haven't  read the book, Johnson didn't support his claims with anything like convincing evidence in the podcast, and I don't know I believe the general idea. 

However, as I was listening, I was reminded of something that appears to be true about me. All my best ideas, the best things I've done, have come to me in moments of, for lack of a better word, "frivolity".
