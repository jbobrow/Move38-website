For those who haven’t been following along, Move38 is a company working on a new kind of smart table game platform, comprised of game pieces that think and communicate, both with players and each other. 

They’re called Blinks (for now), and they look like this:

They have embedded LEDs that can exhibit any time-varying pattern of illumination you care to imagine.

The LEDs are controlled by by programmable boards
Blinks align via magnets and communicate and respond to one another via infrared light

Players can interact with Blinks by moving them around and tapping on their tops to change their states. 

I like to think of them as enchanted cellular automata. They constitute a platform because they can be used to play many games. 

However, we can’t just sell it that way and call it a day. We can’t just say “Here’s a platform and a bunch of games. Go to town”. [maybe link to difficulty of abstract game publishing article]

To help people make sense of it, a platform (especially a weird one without much precedent), needs a signature launch game that fully exploits and illustrates what the system does and what makes it unique. The platform doesn’t sell the platform, the launch title sells the platform. 

As the main game design person at the company, it’s my job to build that game. 

There are a lot of ways I’m going about it, and today I’m going to talk about the history of my search through the lens of a technique I’ve been using in that search: the iterating constraint list. 

It’s simple and applicable to any kind of design project, and I think most everyone should use it. There’s no shortage of people who are familiar with it, but I don’t see it put into use as much as I think it should, in particular for game design, so I’m writing about it.  

An iterating constraint list is what it sounds like: a list of design constraints that a project (in my case, the Blinks launch game) must satisfy. However, it’s not something you just write down and reference. The key to making it work is to rewrite it constantly as your understanding of the problem matures. 

Moreover, to use the list, you don’t try to actually design the game that satisfies all the constraints at once. Rather, you use individual constraints or subsets of them as jumping off points and inspiration for game design. Such lists are better thought of as a set of prompts than as ironclad law, at least at first. 

So here’s a subset of my lists. 

List #0  Crazy idea exploration. List some ideas from the vault, both ones that are becoming real games, others that didn’t, and some of the really stupid ideas.

[rather than relisting everything, just talk about what you added and removed, and why]

List #1
The launch game must use exactly 6 blinks

List #2
The launch game must use exactly 6 blinks
The game does something dynamic even when you’re not touching it
Involves both button presses and tile moves as actions



List #3
The launch game must use exactly 6 blinks
The game does something dynamic even when you’re not touching it
Involves both button presses and tile moves as actions
It’s a wildly funny party game

List #4
The launch game must use exactly 6 blinks
The game does something dynamic even when you’re not touching it
Involves both button presses and tile moves as actions
Emphasizes predicting systems behaviors. I.e. every action has learnably predictable but hard-to-predict cascade effects. 

List #5
The launch game must use exactly 6 blinks
The game does something dynamic even when you’re not touching it
Involves both button presses and tile moves as actions
All the tiles must be together most of the time

List #5
The launch game must use exactly 6 blinks
The game does something dynamic even when you’re not touching it
Involves both button presses and tile moves as actions
All the tiles must be together most of the time
Scales infinitely, both to infinite players and infinite tiles

List #6
The launch game must use exactly 6 blinks
The game does something dynamic even when you’re not touching it
Involves both button presses and tile moves as actions
All the tiles must be together most of the time
Scales infinitely, both to infinite players and infinite tiles
The game should be about color, in some sense
The game should involve continuous color-fluctuations that are meaningful to the game (it would be a different game if the continuous aspects were discretized)

List #7
The launch game must use exactly 6 blinks
The game does something dynamic even when you’re not touching it
Involves both button presses and tile moves as actions
All the tiles must be together most of the time
Scales infinitely, both to infinite players and infinite tiles
The game should be about color, in some sense
The game should involve continuous color-fluctuations that are meaningful to the game (it would be a different game if the continuous aspects were discretized)
Should utilize the 6 LED’s on each tile for game-meaningful effects
Should last 15-30 min

List #8
The launch game must use exactly 6 blinks
The game does something dynamic even when you’re not touching it
Involves both button presses and tile moves as actions
All the tiles must be together most of the time
Scales infinitely, both to infinite players and infinite tiles
The game should be about color, in some sense
The game should involve continuous color-fluctuations that are meaningful to the game (it would be a different game if the continuous aspects were discretized)
Should utilize the 6 LED’s on each tile for game-meaningful effects
Should last 15-30 min
Should appeal to adults
