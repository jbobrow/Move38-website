Our first product at Move38 will be unusual. It's a platform for playing physical games and puzzles, where the playing pieces (illuminated hexagons) are simple computers that communicate with each other and with the players.

They're programmable and you can use them to play many games/puzzles. They're open source ([Arduino!](https://www.arduino.cc/)) so you can also program new games, upload them, and they'll be available  to everyone.

Here they are running a demo program that makes them all try to resolve to the same color:

...and here's what their brains look like:

I fell in love with them the moment [Jonathan](http://cargo.jonathanbobrow.com/), their inventor, showed them to me. Unlike nearly every electronic game in the history of electronic games, they don't feel like a gimmick, and when I play with them, I feel like I'm doing something new (and mesmerizing).

But their novelty is also a weakness. How do we help people understand what they are well enough to know whether they want to buy it?

The question is complicated by the fact that it's harder to sell a platform than a game. If I tell you I'm selling a platform, I tell you nothing about whether you'll like it. But if I'm selling a game, one single game, featuring X, Y and Z, you can understand it because you can relate it to things it you already know.

**Me:** here's a deck building game about Sasquatches

**You:** I love deck building! I love Sasquatches!

**Me:** that'll be $40

For this reason, more than one advisor recommends we create one showpiece game and use that as a lead-in to the platform.

The marketing would go something like: "Here's this game that does X, Y and Z, and oh by the way it's also a platform for playing many other games besides."

But another advisor, one with special knowledge on this subject, warns against trying to have it both ways. He says we should either sell one game or sell a platform but not both. The problem with selling one game that is *also* a platform is that:

1. it's confusing

2. a platform costs more than one game so if it's framed as one game it will seem too expensive. If it's *actually* one game we can make it cheaper by dropping the general computing componentry.

I should mention this advisor once launched, to enormous buzz, a product with the same dilemma. It sold as a platform and failed.

So it would seem we should design and sell a single game and forget the platform stuff. But there's a problem with that too: it conflicts with our values.

As an open-source platform, our product will be a thing for kids in computer labs and makers in garages to hack. People will invent things we could never dream of with it, and others will get to play with those things.

As a platform, it'll be a tool for both competitive play *and* imaginative play.  If we redesign it into a single game, we'll limit the scope for imaginative play, an imaginative play is critical to us. It's the reason we exist.

So a core value conflicts with pragmatic product advice. What imperative do we honor? We're choosing the core value.

But this begs the still-unanswered question: how do we sell a platform?

We don't know the answer, but we're being transparent about the dilemma in the hope smart readers will help us think it through. If you're one, we'll be grateful for your thoughts.
