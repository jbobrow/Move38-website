Our first product at Move38 will be unusual. It's a platform for playing physical games and puzzles, where the playing pieces, which are [Hive](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qKmGJ9JT6kI/maxresdefault.jpg)-sized hexagons, are simple computers that communicate with each other and with the players. 

They're programmable and you can use them to play many games/puzzles. They're open source so you can also program new ones.

Here they are running a demo program that makes them all try to resolve to the same color:

...and here's what their innards look like:

I fell in love with them the moment Jonathan, their inventor, showed them to me. Unlike nearly every other electronic game in the history of electronic games, they don't feel like a gimmick, and when I play with them, I feel like I'm doing something new. 

But their novelty is also a weakness. How do we help people understand what they are well enough to know whether the product is right for them? 

The question is complicated by the fact that it's harder to sell a system than a game. If I tell you I'm selling a system, that doesn't tell you whether you like it or not yet. On the other hand, if I tell you I'm selling a game, one single game, where you do X,Y, and Z, then you know. You think to yourself "I like X, Y, and Z, so this is one for me". Easy.
