Since we're starting a company with play as a central value, I've been thinking about it. What is it, and do we have a right to it?

Let's start with what it means to play. The most succinct definition I can conjure is:

**to follow one's instincts, but in the total absence of fear**

Fear is the operative word. It's the reason play is easier when we're young (and less fearful) and harder when we're old (and fear is a more regular, nay instinctual, companion).

It's also what makes play seem alternately precious and frivolous.

Precious because fear, in degrees minor and profound, is ubiquitous, and play accordingly rare.

Frivolous because for swaths of humanity, fear of one kind or another is a necessity, and play therefore seems like a nice perk afforded to the lucky among us who have somehow escaped the need for constant watchfulness.

As a white man (whenever I see these two words together I imagine I'm sitting at a slot machine, watching them rotate into alignment), I'm one of those people. I've spent big parts of my adult life trying to cultivate a spirit of play, mainly because from where I sit, it looks like freedom. But I feel guilt too, because I'm getting to do something more or less off limits to a lot of others.

I've noticed many spaces in which adults gather to cultivate a spirit of play are unbelievably white. For example:

* improv clubs - I did improv for three years, and oh my god was it white.

* game conventions - I've worked in the board game industry for the last few years, attending conventions professionally, and here too I attest to a pervasive and blinding whiteness.

* Burning Man - I've never been but it has a notorious reputation for whiteness (the founder's explanation: [“I don’t think black folks like to camp as much as white folks”](https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2015/sep/04/burning-man-founder-larry-harvey-race-diversity-silicon-valley))

My theory is that the more fear you've lived with, the harder or more frivolous (or both) these sorts of pursuits seem.  So you don't undertake them. You leave them to the privileged.

But. If it's true, as I believe, that we learn best when at play, it means play is yet another means through which privilege breeds privilege. I can explore my interests more freely, more passionately, than someone more encumbered by fear, and that leads me to opportunities out of reach for others. 

A close-at-hand example: my participation in this business, Move38, the business whose site you're reading right now.

I was traveling for work in Boston, staying at the house of a friend who was teaching at MIT (this story originates in a traditional kind of privilege - I'm friends with people who have access to incredible resources), and he told me there was an inventor in the MIT Media Lab who I absolutely had to meet. 

So we go to the media lab, and I meet an amazing man named Jonathan Bobrow, who had developed a kind of board game with pieces that can think for themselves, communicate with one another, and act like living things. I play with them briefly, I talk to Jonathan briefly, and I'm blown away by both. 

Here's where the privilege of play comes in: I tell Jonathan, without any consideration, that if he wants to commercialize his invention, I will leave my job and join him in doing so.

I discovered something delightful and I pursued it without fear. I made my decision playfully. Of course, there was some apprehension later on, once I actually gave my 30 days notice, because I'm human and fear is a condition of life, even for the lucky. 

But it wasn't enough fear to keep me from making the playful choice. Here I am. I can do this because I'm one of the lucky ones, I'm used to operating with little fear, and I have a bedrock belief I'll land on my feet. 

So. Play is yet another dimension of the social capital that keeps white guys like me hitting jackpots in life's slot machine.  

But it shouldn't be that way. It shouldn't be a privilege. It should be a right. An inalienable one. 

I don't know how it'll become so or how we can contribute to it. Our company's first product won't address the underlying fear that thwarts play. I wouldn't even know where to start. 

For now it's a dream, but one we won't forget.
