I've been thinking about play: what is it, and do we have a right to it?

Let's start with what it means to play. The most succinct definition I can conjure is:

**to follow one's instincts, but in the total absence of fear**

Fear is the operative word. It's the reason play is easier when we're young (and less fearful) and harder when we're old (and fear is a more regular, nay instinctual, companion).

It's also what makes play seem both precious and frivolous.

Precious because fear, in degrees minor and profound, is ubiquitous, and play commensurately rare.

Frivolous because for huge swaths of humanity, fear  of one kind or another is a necessity, and play therefore seems like a nice perk afforded to the lucky among us who have somehow escaped the need for constant watchfulness.

As a rich white man (whenever I see these three words together I imagine I'm sitting at a slot machine, watching them rotate into alignment), I'm one of those people. I've spent big parts of my adult life trying to cultivate a spirit of play, mainly because from where I sit, it looks like freedom. But I feel guilt in the this pursuit too, because I'm getting to do something more or less off limits to a lot of others.  

I've noticed many spaces in which adults gather to cultivate a spirit of play are unbelievably white. For example:

* improv clubs - I did improv for three years, and oh my god was it white.

* game conventions - I've worked in the board game industry for the last few years, attending conventions professionally, and here too I attest to a pervasive and blinding whiteness.

* Burning Man - I've never been but it has a notorious reputation for whiteness (the founder's explanation: [“I don’t think black folks like to camp as much as white folks”](https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2015/sep/04/burning-man-founder-larry-harvey-race-diversity-silicon-valley))

My theory is that the more fear you've lived with, the harder or more frivolous (or both) these sorts of pursuits seem.  So you don't do them. You leave them to the priviledged.
