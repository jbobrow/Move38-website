The [Global Game Jam](http://globalgamejam.org/) (not to be confused with the Global Gam Jam, which is a TOTALLY different thing) is a big yearly event where game makers around the world come together in various locations for a weekend of intense game design.

The [New York University Game Center](http://gamecenter.nyu.edu/) is always an active participant, and this year, Blinks will be featured!

You can read more about Blinks and see them in action [here](http://move38.com/blog/a-board-game-that-thinks/) and [here](http://move38.com/blog/game-in-development-live-free-or-die/), and you can [see details about the Game Jam and register here](http://globalgamejam.org/2017/jam-sites/nyu-game-center). If you're a game person and you're anywhere near New York January 20-22, we'd love to have you there and will shower you with kisses or some other form of affection that doesn't invade your personal space so much. \
