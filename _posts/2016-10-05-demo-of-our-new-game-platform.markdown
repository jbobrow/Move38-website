The video above shows 3 people people playing a prototype of our company's flagship project, a game platform called Automatiles (for now; they may have a different name by the time they ship. Thinky Blinky Bits?)

The game featured in the video is called Fracture. At its start, the tiles are arranged into bunches so the tiles of one color are clustered together. Then:

1. The players take turns.

2. On your turn, you break the array of tiles into two chunks and put it back together in another formation. 

3. When a tile has at least two neighbors but none match its color, it feels happy and it starts blinking. 

4. The first player whose tiles are all happy at once wins.  

Fracture illustrates a some nice things about the system: 

1. It's hard to play a game like this with inanimate pieces because players have to manually scan the array to check for happy tiles, which is annoying and game-delaying. Automatiles show you when they're happy and that lets the game shine through.

2. Because the tiles attach and self-align through magnets, the array has a pleasing organization and is easy to manipulate; you can do so not just on the level of single tiles but of whole groups. 

3. There's something mesmerizing about them (in our ever so slightly biased opinion)  

As you can see, these tiles are reactive. They're also programmable. Here's what one looks like without it's skin:
