You know why you're here. Let's get down to it:

1. Hexagons one of only three kinds of regular polygons that tile the plane. The others are equilateral triangles (boring) and squares (square)

2. They have more sides than any other regular polygon that tiles the plane. So hotttt.

3. Honeybees make honey in them.

4. if you're into fancy dancy design stuff, you're legally obligated to use hexagons these days.

5. They're the basis of like, a huge swath of organic chemistry and like, life wouldn't exist without them. Benzene ring baby! 

6. Normally we'd stop after 6 bullet points because that's the number of sides a hexagon has, but hexagons are so cool we have to keep going. 

7. Hexagons tile the plane with the minimum total perimeter length. Meaning if you draw a tiled plane, you'll minimize wear and tear on your pencil.
